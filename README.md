This repository documents my **self-learning journey in Python for Data Science**.  
It contains a collection of **Jupyter Notebooks**, **code samples**, and **personal notes** created as I explore concepts and tools essential for working with data using Python.

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your skills, feel free to **use this repository as a learning resource**.

## 🔍 What I'm Learning

- **Basic Python Programming**  
  Data types, control structures, loops, functions, file handling, and OOP.

- **Popular Data Science Libraries**  
  - `NumPy`: Arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations  
  - `Pandas`: Data wrangling, merging, filtering, and analysis  
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization and plotting fundamentals

- **Data Collection Techniques**  
  - Web scraping with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`  
  - APIs and working with JSON

- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**  
  - Handling missing data  
  - Grouping, aggregating  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🛠️ Local Setup Recommendation

While JupyterLite and Google Colab are great for many exercises, some projects—especially those involving **file system access**, **custom packages**, or **larger datasets**—**must be run locally** on your machine.

### ✅ Recommended: Install Anaconda

To get a complete Python and Jupyter setup with all key libraries pre-installed:

🔗 [Download Anaconda (Free)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

Once installed, launch **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** from Anaconda Navigator or terminal.
