# Python Learning for Data Science

This repository documents my self-learning journey in Python for Data Science. It is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, code samples, and notes created as I explore various concepts and tools essential for working with data using Python.

## 🔍 What I'm Learning

- **Basic Python Programming**  
  Data types, control structures, functions, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

- **Popular Data Science Libraries**  
  - `NumPy`: Working with arrays, vectorized operations, and basic statistics  
  - `Pandas`: Data wrangling, cleaning, filtering, and analysis  
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization and plotting

- **Data Collection Techniques**  
  - Web scraping with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` etc
  - Working with APIs and JSON

- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**  
  Handling missing data, merging datasets, groupby operations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📚 Learning Sources

- YouTube tutorials by data science educators
- Free online courses and blog articles
- Kaggle datasets and notebooks

## 🚀 Goal

To build a strong foundation in Python for Data Science, enabling me to work confidently on real-world datasets, understand core analytical workflows, and transition into more advanced topics like machine learning and data storytelling.
